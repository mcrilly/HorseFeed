# .NET Code Challenge

This application will process data from 2 different files types with 2 different structures.
An XML file and a json file.

The data from both files will be read and the horse names will be ouput sorted by price ascending

## How to use

Copy your data files into the 'FeedData' folder location and run the application

The sample data files are:
* Caulfield_Race1.xml https://beteasy.com.au/racing-betting/horse-racing/caulfield/20171216/race-1-798068-25502504  
* Wolferhampton_Race1.json https://beteasy.com.au/racing-betting/horse-racing/wolverhampton/20171213/race-1-797507-25500650


## Ideas

With additonal time, I would look into making the parsing of the data much faster - as I expect that in your company these services need to run as quickly as possible.
I would also add further error handling to support additional file types and file formats.



Thanks,
Matt.
